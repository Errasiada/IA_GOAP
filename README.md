# IA_GOAP

In this practice the main task is creating an Unity 3D project applying a GOAP system. A Goal Oriented Action Planning (GOAP) is an IA system that will easily give your agents choices and the tools to make smart decisions without having to maintain a large and complex finite state machine.

For this demo, there will be three Agent types. These are the actions that those Agents will take place:

- Customer Agent: 

1. Arrive to the bar

2. Order

3. Go to the table

4. Eat / Drink

5. Leave the bar

- Chef Agent:

1. Arrive to the kitchen

2. Cook

3. Call the barman

- Barman Agent:

1. Arrive to the bar

2. Serve food/drink

3. Clean tables


After deciding the agent's behaviours, I used several Assets from the Unity Asset Store to recreate the scene.
