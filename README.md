# IA_GOAP

In this practice the main task is creating an Unity 3D project applying a GOAP system. A Goal Oriented Action Planning (GOAP) is an IA system that will easily give your agents choices and the tools to make smart decisions without having to maintain a large and complex finite state machine.

For this demo, there will be three Agent types. These are the actions that those Agents will take place:

- Customer Agent: 1. Arrive to the bar 2. Order Menu 3. Go to the table 4. Leave the bar

- Barman Agent: 1. Arrive to the kitchen 2. Prepare Menu 3. Serve Menu 4. Kick jehovas witnesses

- Jehovas Witness Agent: 1. Arrive to the bar 2. Disturb customers 3. Leave bar

- Delivery Man agent 1. Arrive to the bar 2. Deliver products 3. Leave bar

After deiciding the different agents and its behaviours, I created the map- There is the kitchen and bar area where the barman agent moves, the chairs and tables for the customer, and an exit and entrance area. Also, different prefabs as the characters. The yellow characters are the Customers, the black character is the Jehova Witness, and the orange character are the Barman - Delivery man.
