# IA_GOAP

In this practice the main task is creating an Unity 3D project applying a GOAP system. A Goal Oriented Action Planning (GOAP) is an IA system that will easily give your agents choices and the tools to make smart decisions without having to maintain a large and complex finite state machine.

For this demo, there will be three Agent types. These are the actions that those Agents will take place:

- Child Agent: 

1. Arrive to the park

2. Play with the wheel

3. Play with the slide

4. Run

- Cleric Agent:

1. Arrive to the park

2. Sit in a bench

3. Chase the Child

- Policeman Agent:

1. Arrive to the park

2. Stay near the stand

3. Chase the Cleric

After deciding the agent's behaviours, I used several Assets from the Unity Asset Store to recreate the scene, such as Playground Lowpoly, Lowpoly Medieval Priest, Lowpoly 3D Animated Nuts and Police Officer.
